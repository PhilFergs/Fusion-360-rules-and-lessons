Phils Bom (PhilsBom) - Install Instructions (v1.03)

This add-in installs by copying the PhilsBom.bundle folder into Fusion's
ApplicationPlugins directory.

1) Unzip the package
- Unzip PhilsBom.bundle-1.03.zip.
- Look at the unzipped folder contents.
- You should see a folder named: PhilsBom.bundle
  - Make sure this folder contains: Contents\Resources\Icon

2) Copy the bundle to the ApplicationPlugins folder

Windows:
- Open File Explorer and paste this into the address bar:
  %AppData%\Autodesk\ApplicationPlugins
- Only copy the PhilsBom.bundle folder into that directory (not the whole unzipped folder).

macOS:
- In Finder, use Go > Go to Folder... and paste:
  ~/Library/Application Support/Autodesk/ApplicationPlugins
- Only copy the PhilsBom.bundle folder into that directory (not the whole unzipped folder).

3) Start (or restart) Fusion
- Fully close Fusion 360, then open it again.

4) Run the add-in
- In Fusion, go to: Tools > Add-ins > Scripts and Add-ins
- Find "PhilsBom" under the Add-Ins tab.
- Click Run.
- (Optional) Enable "Run on Startup" if you want it always available.

5) Use it
- Right-click in the canvas.
- Open the "Phils Bom" menu.
- Choose "Create BOM" or "Phils Bom Settings".

Troubleshooting
- If it does not appear, double-check that the final path looks like:
  .../ApplicationPlugins/PhilsBom.bundle/PackageContents.xml
- If an older version exists, delete or rename it, then restart Fusion.
